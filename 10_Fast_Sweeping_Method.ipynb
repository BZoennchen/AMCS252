Thus solutions are defined in a weak sense, and a notion of viscosity is introduced in order to select a unique weak solution.  This is similar to the theory of nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs, where shock singularities may appear, but in Eikonal equations the solution is generally continuous (but not differentiable)."

      "\n",
      "First we will use an iterative method based on Gauss-Seidel sweeps.  That means that we will march across the grid, updating the solution value at each point.  When updating a given point, we will use new neighbor values for the neighboring points that we have already updated and old neighbor values for the points that we haven't updated yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The advantage of this approach is that, at each point, we have a quadratic equation for $U_{ij}$, with all the equation coefficients known.  That means that we can use the quadratic formula to obtain an explicit solution and avoid doing Newton iterations.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can ensure that the Gauss-Seidel iteration converges by the following means.  Remember that we are computing, in some metric, the distance to each point on the grid.  Initially, we set the distance at all points (outside of $\\Gamma$) to be infinite, or very large).  At each iteration, we only update the value at a given point if the update would cause it to *decrease*.  Furthermore, we only base the decrease on neighboring points whose distance is shorter than that of the point $(i,j)$.  Essentially, we are looking for the shortest path to each point from $\\Gamma$ using *dynamic programming*.\n",

After the initial four sweeps, the process can be repeated until convergence (i.e., until no solution values change anymore).  However, in Zhao's paper it is shown that, after the first 4 directional sweeps, the error doesn't get any smaller -- it is always ${\\mathcal O}(h)$."
